# Multilayer Perceptron
This project focuses on the implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Backpropagation algorithm for a Neural Networks course. It demonstrates the practical application of theoretical concepts learned in the course, providing a hands-on approach to understanding MLP architectures and their training processes using Backpropagation.
